Mac Setup
- Make sure that you have postfix running.
- I had to make sure to follow the steps below to make Lion work with Postfix to send the mail out:
Adam-Parrishs-MacBook-Pro:~ waparrish$ sudo touch /etc/postfix/submit.cred
Adam-Parrishs-MacBook-Pro:~ waparrish$ sudo chmod 777 /etc/postfix/submit.cred
Adam-Parrishs-MacBook-Pro:~ waparrish$ sudo echo "submitcred version 1" >> /etc/postfix/submit.cred
Adam-Parrishs-MacBook-Pro:~ waparrish$ sudo echo "localhost|waparrish|test" >> /etc/postfix/submit.cred
Adam-Parrishs-MacBook-Pro:~ waparrish$ sudo chmod 600 /etc/postfix/submit.cred
Adam-Parrishs-MacBook-Pro:~ waparrish$ sudo postfix restart

Compilation:
- mvn clean install should build the whole application

Running:
cd to commons-user-webapp
mvn cargo:start
